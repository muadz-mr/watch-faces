### Watch Faces Design & Animation

This watch faces were designed using Figma and using Quicksand font from Google Fonts.

This project was done using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No jQuery, no framework. I was brushing up my vanilla JS skill before getting into ReactJS and back-end stuff.

The idea was to change the background gradient and animate the illustrations depending on the time.

For the purpose of showing that all work, I made the background and illustrations change after 20 seconds. It would be very long to wait for hours just to see the effects. :D
